# Project development is temporarily stopped due to technical issues
## Requirements:

> python 3.10+

> pip3 install sqlite3, telebot

## Important:

Note that just installing the source code and running ```main.py``` will not be enough to make the telegram bot work! First you need to do these steps:
1. Create your own telegram bot with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather)
2. Copy the bot's API token and pate it into the ```__misc__/_bot_token_.txt``` file
3. Create the ```__misc__/_threads_``` directory

## Future plans:

1. Host a bot and make it something bigger than just a github repo
2. Make the bot asynchronous (there are some problems with AsyncTeleBot right now)
3. Improve some things about the threads
4. Passwords encryption & decryption
